# Posture

### Getting started
To start Git clone or download the repo.

### Developing
1. In Chrome's address bar, enter: `chrome://extensions/`
2. Turn on `developer mode` in the top right corner and then click `Load unpacked`
3. Go into the directory where you have the repo and select the folder.
4. You are good to get started!

### Using
1. Load a page
2. Wait for Chrome to prompt you for camera access, click `Allow`
3. Sit in good posture, click the Chrome extension. It should change its colour to green to show you it's on.
4. If you change your posture, your screen will blur! Fix your posture and your screen will be back to normal.

### What's next?
We are committed to keeping all of this open-source! We'd love you to continue building on what we started :)
